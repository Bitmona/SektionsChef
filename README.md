## SDCopy by Sektionschef
This tool was created as a batch converter for JVC/Panasonic camcorders that use the MOD format. It converts batches of files from MOD to MPG and sets the widescreen bit correctly. This tool is one of a kind for this job and although there are others, SDCopy does the job better and faster than the newer programs (Especially when converting your whole hard drive).
